The customer might want to use a private repository rather than a public one for a few reasons. 
One reason may be that the customer wants to keep their work confidential and not publicly accessible. 
They may also be using proprietary data or information that they do not want to share publicly. 
Additionally, using a private repository allows for more control over access and permissions for the repository, which can be useful for managing a team or project.
